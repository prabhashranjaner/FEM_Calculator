## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React with **useReducer**

### What I learned

**Three-way-toggle Switch**

At first it looked easy. I knew how to make two way custom swich. But this was very challenging. With some effort I think I did great.

**State management with useReducer**
